# Welcome to PicPoster!

Hi! This is Markdown file for project **PicPoster**.


# Project Description

> **PicPoster** is my web application, built on Laravel. This project was built for trying out Laravel. 
> PicPoster is an Instagram-lookalike-clone, but over simplified. The main stuff is that user can authenticate, receive a 'welcome email' to his mailbox, edit own profile, add posts, follow other users and see their posts on the personal feed.
> Since designed only as a text project, some parts are imperfect.

# Starting the Project

To start the application, you should have somthing that can boot up laravel project.
Parts that honorable for mentioning:
 1. Sqlite database used. 
 2. Emailing, through mailtrap.io
 3. Telescope, downloaded through artisan
 4. Vue, that was packed with Laravel
 5. JQuery v. 3.5.*
 6. Bootstrap v. 4.*
 7. Laragon 
 
Neat little functionalities:
 1. Image uploading
 2. Mail receiving on registration
 3. Profile Feed and Profile Page
 4. Button created with Vue.js

# About Structure, Simplified
PicPoster, like any other Laravel project, uses MVC structure. Through this I am able to create Models, that will be used by controllers, to show Views to the end user.
> And thats basically it!
